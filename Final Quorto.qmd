## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

There are `r inline_text(table1, variable="Asian", level="Yes", column="NY")` people who were Asian and from the New York clinic in this study.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-one
#| tbl-cap: "Descriptive Statistics"
#| output-location: slide
table1<-tbl_summary(
	opt,
	by=Clinic,
	include=c(Group, Age, Black, White, Nat.Am, Asian, Hisp, Education
	))
table1
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-two
#| tbl-cap: "Regression Statistics"
#| output-location: slide
table2<-logistic_model<-glm(Group~Age+Education, data=opt, family = binomial())
tbl_regression(
	logistic_model,
	exponentiate =TRUE,
	label = list(
		Age ~ "Age of Women",
		Education ~ "Level of Education"
	))
table2
```

The average age of study participants was `r round(age_avg, 1)`

```{r}
#| label: fig1
#| boxplot-cap: "Figure 1"
#| output-location: slide
bp<-boxplot(opt$Age~opt$Clinic,
				xlab="Clinic",
				ylab="Age",
				main="Participants Ages by Clinic")
bp
age_avg<-mean(opt$Age, na.rm=TRUE)
```
